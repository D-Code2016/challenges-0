#Cardwalls

Cardwalls are an important tool used in project development. Cardwalls keep the team organized and provide a snapshot of where
the team is in regards to progress at any given moment. They are called cardwalls because many teams choose to use a physical 
cardwall which is usually constructed on an actual wall with sticky notes as cards. Other teams use electronic cardwalls like 
Jira or Trello. For this class we will be using Trello so that's what we are going to focus on. 

These walls contain labels for the "state" of the cards such as "in progress" or "done". The cards contain detailed information about tasks that need to be completed throughout **development cycles**. This may include **"user stories"** which are short stories that detail how something should function from the user's perspective. That information is used by developers to then build out the functionality. Cardwalls may also contain cards that **project mananger's** may use to track the project such as tasks that relate to setting meetings or getting some **asset** that the development team needs to complete their work.


## What is Trello?

Trello is a tool that allows users to create a cardwalls or boards with list labels and cards. It also allows customization such as color coded labels such as "project management" and "development" so cards can be sorted by who is responsible for completing the tasks.
