Design Comps are used to define how something will look when developed. In software development design comps are created by a designer and includes details such as the colors that should be used, font types and sizes as well as the placement of **assets**. Assets are typically images, gifs, buttons, etc that are used in the views. Developers use design comps as a guide for coding out the views of the applications. In web development, developers use **CSS files** to implement the styling for html pages.
